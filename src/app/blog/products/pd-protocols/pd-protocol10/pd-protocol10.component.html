            Select the appropriate single arch attachment, place bite registration material on the Single Arch attachment; and position
            it on the dentate arch in order to obtain an occlusal imprint. (For single arch upper proceed to step 7 and then
            skip to step 9; for single arch lower proceed to step 8.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the pin on the single arch attachment and place the trays back in the mouth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Clean Lower impression releasing the lingual grooves. Attach the tracing pin to the lower tray, until you feel it snap into
            place. Place the trays back in the mouth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjust the pin height to the desired VDO.

            Locate your desired CR point & create a dimple in which center will be the traced CR position.

          </li>
          <li>
            Seat trays into the mouth. Make sure the pin locks into the dimple and that the trays are not touching in the posterior section.

          <li>
            Inject bite registration material between the trays.

            Place lip ruler on the incisive papilla & record upper lip measurement, by looking at the numbers from eye level. (If measurement
            is not possible due to the presence of teeth, place it at estimated height outside the mouth and measure on top
            of the lip).
